## Brainstorm Prompts

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The exploration of genome mutations and their association with external stressors, such as environmental toxins or drug resistance, has been particularly fascinating. Additionally, the use of language models for genome analysis opens up innovative methods for understanding sequence structure and mutation prediction.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I would like to investigate whether mutations in malaria genomes, identified through language models, correlate with drug resistance. This project could leverage sequence embedding and surprise-based metrics to determine if specific mutations are indicative of adaptive changes to drug exposure.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I would explore the use of additional GPUs to improve model accuracy and training efficiency. Additionally, I would consider incorporating multiclass classification techniques with embeddings to improve prediction granularity and enable more complex analyses.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Techniques like de Bruijn graph traversal for genome assembly and language model applications for sequence prediction seem highly promising. Exploring per-sample metagenomic assembly, or categorizing metadata such as age or antibiotic exposure, could also reveal unique insights into genomic variation.

## Additional Brainstorm Ideas

- Use supervised learning to predict unknown classifications in genomic data.  
- Investigate surprising mutations in genomes, correlating them with functional changes.  
- Compare genomes from exposed vs. unexposed populations to environmental stressors (e.g., smokers vs. non-smokers).  
- Perform per-sample metagenomic assembly to identify genes linked to health divergences.  
- Use NLP models to identify incorrectly assembled genomes or sequences from different species.  
- Apply a model to predict paths in a de Bruijn graph for genome assembly.
